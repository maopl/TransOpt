## Installation

TransOpt is composed of two main components: the backend for data processing and business logic, and the frontend for user interaction. Each can be installed as follows:

### Prerequisites

Before installing TransOpt, you must have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **Node.js and npm**: These are required to install and build the frontend. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Please install these prerequisites if they are not already installed on your system.

### Backend Installation

**Install from source:**
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/maopl/TransOpt.git
   $ cd TransOpt
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py install
   $ bash scripts/init_docker.sh
   ```

### Frontend Installation

Navigate to the `webui` directory and install the necessary packages:

```shell
$ cd webui && npm install
```

## Getting Started

After installation, you can start the backend and frontend as follows:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```shell
   $ transopt-server
   ```

2. In a new terminal, launch the frontend:
   ```shell
   $ cd webui && npm start
   ```
This will open the TransOpt interface in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
